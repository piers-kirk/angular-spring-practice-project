I developed this application to enhance my understanding of the frameworks I would be using in my role as a Software Engineer at QSMI.

The backend is written in Java 8 with Spring Boot, and I am using the Apache POI library to create the Show Export functionality. The frontend is developed using Angular.

I am using Docker to host a Microsoft SQL Server instance as part of the development environment. I deployed the application on Heroku and am using PostgreSQL in production.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my application! I have several enhancements planned for this project, primarily focusing on backend tasks such as adding authentication and authorization with Spring Security.

I created this project independently but frequently used ChatGPT to accelerate development and learn new topics, such as backend server configuration.
