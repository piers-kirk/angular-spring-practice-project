<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>
  I developed this application to enhance my understanding of the frameworks I would be using in my role as a Software Engineer at QSMI.

  The backend is written in Java 8 with Spring Boot, and I am using the Apache POI library to create the Show Export functionality. The frontend is developed using Angular.
  
  I am using Docker to host a Microsoft SQL Server instance as part of the development environment. I deployed the application on Heroku and am using PostgreSQL in production.
  
  Thank you for taking the time to check out my application! I have several enhancements planned for this project, primarily focusing on backend tasks such as adding authentication and authorization with Spring Security.
  
  I created this project independently but frequently used ChatGPT to accelerate development and learn new topics, such as backend server configuration. I am using the freely available TV MAZE API to populate the show data. You can find more information about this API <a href="[url](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-search)">here</a>.
